    <h2>By [Nathan Magloire]</h2>
    <p>The story that would be told is about a man that goes by Nathan. We’ll see his perception in life. When it comes to hearing, he hears multiple voices and sounds all at once. The audience would notice a basketball player with multiple: pieces of equipment attached to one being. Sports represents Nathan tremendously because he finds it entertaining to play and watch. Video games also assisted Nathan as they helped expand his imagination. He used to like red. As he grew into a teenager, he started liking blue more. He sees burgundy as a red shade that’s dying. While; looking at sky blue, more of living color. Overall this is the story of Nathan.</p>
